# datacake-openai-integration
Artifacts from the demo dashboard with AI integration project
In the summer of 2024 I developed an Datacake IoT dashboard that integrated with an OpenAI LLM using a Google App Script. This repository contains a write-up of the effort and 2 supporing log files. The write-up provides a system overview and lessons learned. 

The repository contains the following files:
1 Integrating Datacake with OpenAI.pdf - This is the write-up of the project. 
2 Datacake Outbound Webhook Log â€“ LAQ4.xlsx - This is a log file of data sent by the LAQ4_1 device
3 Log_ai_laq4.xlsx - This is a log file from the Google App Script used to interface between Datacake and the LLM
